** Provide conversion tools to/from XLIFF (XML)                        :next:
This'll get us:
  1. Fully-featured tools for translators (incl. comment support).
  2. Smart flagging and reporting: missing, fuzzy, obsolete, etc.
** Migrate to ICU4J?                                                  :maybe:
Stronger than native JVM library, esp. for pluralization. But is it worth the
dependency and added complication?
** Possibly geospatial/geocoordinates stuff?                          :maybe:
* TESTS
** Write some!
