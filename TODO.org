#+STARTUP: overview, hidestars
#+TAGS: urgent underway maybe waiting hammock next
* DOCS
** Write basic README.                                             :underway:
* API
** Ring with-locale middleware                                     :underway:
Grab locale from session, URI, or headers.
** Migrate to ICU4J?                                                  :maybe:
Stronger than native JVM library, esp. for pluralization. But is it worth the
dependency and added complication?
** Provide conversion tools to/from XLIFF (XML)
This'll get us:
  1. Fully-featured tools for translators (incl. comment support).
  2. Smart flagging and reporting: missing, fuzzy, obsolete, etc.
* TESTS
** Write some!
